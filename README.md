<h1>NetworkDiagram</h1>

The Network Diagram is an Open Source initiative that aimed through a JSON object to create a network diagram. This initiative came about through a feature that wanted to put into practice the system that I developed in my Work Completion of the Bachelor, which wanted to develop a network diagram to show graphically the logical paths of activities and its dependencies, but did not find any code that helps to me in this task. I ask for help to all who interrese to help me make this functional application for everyone and together we share-knowledge. <br>

<h1>How it works the NetworkDiagram?</h1>

This need has occurred in my Work Completion of the Bachelor, the theme: <br>
<b>DESENVOLVIMENTO DE UMA APLICAÇÃO USANDO A METODOLOGIA PERT-CPM (DEVELOPMENT OF AN APPLICATION USING THE METHODOLOGY PERT-CPM) </b>

one goal would be to create a procedure where the system automatically generates up the diagram following the activities and their successors, but as already mentioned in the chapter above was not possible because I did not find anything like it on the internet and had no time for this task.
